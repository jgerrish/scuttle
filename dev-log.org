To fix issues with Unbound module errors in the parser.mly file,
we moved to using menhir as a parser generator.

Using menhir removes the need to use Makefile to patch the generated
interface file.

Unfortunately, there are still issues with Unbound module errors if we
don't generate separate libraries.  So the parser was moved into a
separate library.

The parser is the highest-level API available currently.  The core
scuttle library that includes Card, Deck, etc. may be refactored to
ScuttleCore and a new interface provided for toplevel in the Scuttle
library.

Currently, no additional features of menhir are used, but make is
no longer needed and builds shouldn't fail on a fresh opam install.

We already had a shuffle function in the Deck module, this adds a
shuffle command to the language.  This was implemented in the game
engine, parser.  A basic test was added.

The next update we'll update the Game module, using sets instead of
lists to store game elements.  This will involve changes and renaming
of the BuildDeck and other commands.

Started adding a new AddPlayer command to the GameEngine.

The first step in the is adding a Player module to encapsulate a
player type and the functions that operate on that type.

More tests were added for the Player module, along with examples of
how to use it.

Next, we'll add a PlayerSet module instead of using a list to store
players in the game data structure.  Then functions will be added to
Game and Game_engine to let us add players to games.
